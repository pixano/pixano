# Contributing to Pixano

Thank you for your interest in Pixano! Here you will find information on running Pixano locally and guidelines on how to publish your contributions.

## Getting started

### Issue and suggestions

If you find a bug or you think of some missing features that could be useful while using Pixano, please [open an issue](https://github.com/pixano/pixano/issues)!

### Modifications

To contribute more actively to the project, you are welcome to develop the fix or the feature you have in mind, and [create a pull request](https://github.com/pixano/pixano/pulls)!

And if you want to change the application to your liking, feel free to [fork this repository](https://github.com/pixano/pixano/fork)!

## Running Pixano locally

If you are looking to contribute to Pixano and develop new features, you will need to clone the Pixano repository and run it locally.

### Requirements

#### Backend

You will need `python == 3.10`. Then, inside the root `pixano/` directory, run this command to install all the Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install .
```

#### Frontend

You will need `node ~= 18.17` and `pnpm ~= 8.6`. Then, you will need to run this to install all the pnpm dependencies:

```bash
cd ui/
pnpm i
```

### Running the server and apps

First, you will need to launch the backend server using this command:

```bash
LIBRARY_DIR=your_datasets_directory/ uvicorn pixano.app:create_app --factory --reload
```

Then, in another terminal, you can launch the frontend apps using:

```bash
cd ui/
pnpm --parallel run dev
```

This command should provide you with a `http://localhost` link you can open in your browser to access the Pixano app.

Both the backend server and the frontend apps should refresh automatically when you make changes to the code.

## Testing the code

### Backend

We test our backend code with Python's built-in `unittest` framework.

All our unit testing files are in the `tests/` folder, with a `test_` prefix.

### Frontend

Our frontend code is tested using Storybook, which you can launch with the following command:

```bash
cd ui/
pnpm -r run storybook
```

## Formatting and linting the code

### Backend

We format Python files and Jupyter notebooks with the **Black formatter**.

You can install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter" target="_blank">Visual Studio Extension</a> and set it to format files automatically on save.

Or you can use the Python package:

```bash
pip install black
black pixano/
black notebooks/
```

### Frontend

We format frontend files (Typescript, Javascript, Svelte, HTML, CSS, JSON, YAML, Markdown) with the **Prettier formatter**.

You can install the <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode" target="_blank">Visual Studio Extension</a> (and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode
" target="_blank">this Extension</a> for Svelte) and set them to format files automatically on save.

Or you can use the command line we have set up:

```bash
cd ui/
pnpm format
```

We also lint frontend files with **eslint**.

You can use the command line we have set up:

```bash
cd ui/
pnpm lint
```

## Formatting your commits

We format our commit messages with **the <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary" target="_blank">Conventional Commits</a> guidelines.**

## Updating the changelog

When you want to create a pull request with the changes you have made, please update the CHANGELOG.md accordingly.

We format our changelog with **the <a href="https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/#how" target="_blank">Keep a Changelog</a> guidelines.**
